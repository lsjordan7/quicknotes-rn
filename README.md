QuickNotes – A Lightweight, Fast, Themed Note-Taking App (React Native + Expo)**

A mobile app built with craftsmanship, clean architecture, and thoughtful UX.

QuickNotes is a cross-platform note-taking application built using React Native, Expo, and modern front-end architecture. It focuses on clarity, speed, and simplicity — with small touches of polish that reflect real product-level thinking.

This project was built to demonstrate:
	•	Modular architecture
	•	Component-driven UI
	•	Context-based state management
	•	Persistent offline storage
	•	Theming and modern mobile design patterns
	•	Navigation structure
	•	Practical React Native engineering workflows

🚀 Features

✔ Create Notes

Each note includes a title, body content, and timestamp.

✔ Edit Existing Notes

Tap a note → edit → save gracefully with validation and UI animations.

✔ Persistent Storage

Notes are saved locally via Async Storage so your data remains between app sessions.

✔ Light/Dark Theme Toggle

A UI-level toggle that demonstrates theme-aware styling, scalable design tokens, and component reuse.

✔ Floating Action Button (FAB)

A modern, mobile-native action point for quickly adding notes.

✔ Clean, Touch-Optimized UI

The app includes:
	•	Rounded card components
	•	Soft shadows
	•	Animated list changes
	•	Consistent spacing system
	•	Thoughtful color palette based on “digital notepad” inspiration

✔ Navigation with React Navigation

Stack-based navigation between Home → Detail/Screens.

🧱 Architecture Overview

This project is built around clear separation of concerns:

src/hooks/useNotes.tsx

A centralized state manager that uses:
	•	React Context to provide app-wide note access
	•	Custom Hooks for ergonomic API
	•	Async Storage for persistence
	•	Pure functions for adding, updating, deleting notes

This structure mirrors how production mobile apps manage domain logic.

⸻

src/screens/

Each screen is responsible for presentation only:
	•	HomeScreen.tsx
	•	List of notes
	•	Theming
	•	FAB
	•	Add note UI
	•	Animated state transitions
	•	DetailScreen.tsx
	•	Note editing flow
	•	Clean UX for read/edit modes
	•	Title/body validation

⸻

src/components/NoteCard.tsx

A reusable, theme-aware note preview card with:
	•	Tappable hit areas
	•	Press feedback
	•	Time formatting
	•	Multi-line truncation
	•	Light/Dark styling variants

⸻

 App.tsx

The application shell:
	•	Safe Area
	•	NotesProvider
	•	Navigation
	•	Status bar styling

⸻

🧩 Tech Stack
	•	React Native
	•	Expo
	•	TypeScript
	•	React Navigation
	•	Async Storage
	•	Context API
	•	Light/Dark Theme System

🎨 Design Philosophy

QuickNotes intentionally merges minimal engineering with intentional design:
	•	Yellow-based palette inspired by traditional notepads
	•	Friendly rounded shapes
	•	Soft shadows to elevate cards
	•	Legible typography
	•	Clear visual hierarchy
	•	Focus on touch ergonomics

The entire UI was built to show thoughtful craftsmanship and mobile-native sensibilities — not just “make it work,” but make it feel right.

🌱 Future Enhancements

Planned next steps (and great topics to discuss in interviews):
	•	Cloud sync
	•	Note pinning
	•	Better searching / filtering
	•	Offline-first architecture
	•	Multi-folder organization
	•	Swipe-to-delete
	•	Biometric lock for privacy

💬 Why This App Matters (Interview Context)

QuickNotes demonstrates that I can:
	•	Understand architecture
	•	Build modular components
	•	Use React Native with confidence
	•	Solve real debugging issues
	•	Manage state and persistence
	•	Apply clean, thoughtful UI design
	•	Work with mobile patterns (FAB, theming, etc.)
	•	Use Git effectively under pressure
	•	Learn fast, iterate fast, and ship

This app represents not just coding ability — but product sensibility, design intuition, and problem-solving under real technical constraints.
